HA in Kubernetes

To achieve High availability of K8s. We will need to double the number of control plane
components. This allows to eliminate the single point of failure.

Generally we will have the API server, deployed on two different servers
and we will front end with a Load Balancer.

When communicating to the HA K8s cluster, we will be communicating with the 
Load Balancer. The worker nodes kubelets will also be communicating to
the same Load Balancer. 

The other control plane components, except for ETCD will also be made available on both these control plane servers.

For ETCD, we can have two different models
a) Stacked ETCD 
b) External ETCD

In stacked ETCD, the ETCD store sits inside the control plane nodes
while in External ETCD , the ETCD store sits outside the control 
plane nodes and into its own separate node. 

In EKS, we have external ETCD, 2 API server nodes and 3 ETCD nodes
API server front ended by NLB and offers 99.95% SLA
