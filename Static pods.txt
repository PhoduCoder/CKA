pods managed by kubelet

No need for a k8s API server

Path on the node, if you place manifest there, it will create a new pod.

This location is configurable , you can pass arguments to your kubelet that define where this location is going to be,
the default location setup by kubeadm is '/etc/kubernetes/manifests/'

When a kubelet creates a static pod, it will automatically also create a mirror pod for each static pod

Think of it as a ghost representation of the static pod, but you cannot make any changes to it.
