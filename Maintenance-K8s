Cordoning and Draining a K8s Node 

Say you want to perform some maintenance on a node on your cluster.
but you also want to ensure that your applications running on clusters 
are not affected. 

First, you will start by cordoning a node, this will mean 
that the k8s will mark this node as unschedulable.

Next, to gracefully terminate the applications pods running on your 
k8s node, you can do use "kubectl drain <node-name>" command. 

Note that if you have daemon sets running, then this 
won't error out and you will need to add a ignore daemonsets flag 

kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets

Once you have finished the maintenance, you can instruct the k8s
to start reconsidering this node using the uncordon command

kubectl uncordon <node-name>
